year,rating,review
2023,5,"It's really mind-blowing how low of the prices the flights are for this app. What's even more amazing is the best deals seem to all come from this app. I've tried other flight websites and I stumbled upon you all, when I say absolute best prices that's exactly what I mean, especially if you are planning a trip in advance. Try it you won't ever be disappointed"
2023,4,"I really like the kayak app.. it's great for finding prices for many different booking sites. The problem is the search error issue still hasn't been fixed after all these years. Sometimes when I search flights it will only pull about 10 to 20% of the results. Instead of kayak saying ""search error"" it just displays the results with the majority of the flights missing. There's no easy way to get it to search again either, once it thinks it has all the results it just keeps showing the same."
2023,2,"The app no longer works for hotel searches. For the past 6 months everytime i search for a hotel, it floods my list with hotels that arent available for the selected dates. I never find one hotel available until i scroll past 100 unavailable listings. On top of this huge error/glitch, there is no way to quickly contact customer service, it is impossible to contact Kayak through their app, i spent an hour trying to find a ""contact"" button or phone number or email. Big waste of time over and over."
2022,3,"I find Kayak to have the most customizable flight alerts. It's still the only service I know of to offer flexible dates on searches. However, functionality is not great. For ex when i get push notifications for a low price, it doesn't bring me to the alert. I have to manually navigate to the saved search and sometimes i can't even find the low price i was alerted to. Plus there doesn't seem to be a way to opt out of email alerts."
2019,5,"Does as well as any other app and better than any I've tried, including the over-advertised Trivago. Love the ability to track any flight (even see where it is enroute) and the ability to view all departures and arrivals for ALL flights at any airport. I also like the fly to anywhere feature that will show current best rates all over the country, displayed on a map. It also keeps track of all past trips and total miles travelled. I can't think of any negatives."
2021,2,"In the past the app has been pretty accurate with prices. But there's a huge bug in the saved trips right now, where most of the prices in those lists are not refreshing. I have to click on the flight (if it even lets me, doesn't always) to go see what the actual price is, but even then I see the old price when I return to the saved trip. This started after this last update."
2021,5,"This app exceeds my expectations. I'm a first time traveler and Kayak has helped me stay organized, keep me up to date and everything in one place. Alot less stress on my part. Instead of trying to remember what app I used for what reservation and having to search through troves of emails I can just go to kayak and with a few clicks I have every important piece of information. Absolutely love it and recommend it. Especially for first time travelers who have no experience in this area."
2019,2,"It used to be really good, but recently it's just awful. They often direct you to book at shady sites, half the time the price they show isn't actually available when you try to book (just repeatedly keeps saying ""Booking failed"" and suggesting trying again, without ever actually updating the prices), it's incredibly slow, and arguably worst of all, doesn't show the best deals, even when Skyscanner or the airlines' own sites do."
2019,5,"i really like that you can have an open ended destination. i like to take short jaunts here and there, so it helps me pick where to go. I do wish there was a way to set up email alerts with more specific criteria. instead of staying within a certain radius, i would like to stay outside a radius - in my case, i don't want anything within 1K miles. but it is an easy app to use and the notifications are actually helpful and not overbearing in frequency."
2021,1,"This app is just rip-off garbage! First, it doesn't show you the final price of a hotel, so what you end up paying could easily be twice what's shown. Then the hotels this app shows aren't always there. Often, when you click on a hotel to see the ""deal"", the actual cost shown by the hotel is much more. The app doesn't let you filter, and the sort order is simply ""trust us"". This means they shows hotels that have paid a fee higher in the order. I've used the Kayak website before, which is why I downloaded and used the app on a recent trip to Florida (what a mistake!). The website is helpful and useful, and I'll probably continue to use it, but I uninstalled the app while on my trip. My advice - unless you have money falling out of your pockets, don't use this app."
2019,5,"Great app, best feature is that it shows total hotel cost including tax and fees that are typically hidden and hard to find. I wish it had the price chart feature and general dest like ""Europe"" similar to Google flights. What most travel companies dont understand, is that people typically had a target budget but not a specific destination. Imagine an app being able to search: Two week trip, must leave Fri, must be back on Sun, Non-stop flights, Europe, anytime in the next 6 months."
2019,1,"After the break and fix, it's back to unusable. UPDATE : Kayak must have put a fix in. Works great now, as always. I especially like the explorer function. Normally a great app, but the new update makes the app hang. When it eventually starts, I can't log in with email. The login with email button spins. Once Il actually put in my user name and password, but ""submit"" button was grayed out. Literally unusable."
2020,5,"Great little app that's always responsive when you need it. I always check for prices here before I purchase a trip, book a hotel or car rental. I have not used the trip activities section but I understand it is very extensive as well. I also love how easy it is to track all my trip related information no matter where I buy it from. Highly recommended."
2020,5,"Love the ""Trips"" option to email all the ticket confirmations to Kayak and have the app to organize and save them into an itenerary. So nice to have everything in one spot and have reminders of when to check-in. Kayak even told me about a delay and gate change before the airline contacted me. Great job Kayak! I have recommended the app to my friends/family who have multiple flights and events to keep up with. My favorite travel app! Please keep it free and have a transparent privacy policy."
2019,1,"Scam. Getting significantly higher prices for identical flights at the same time as my friend right next to me. Tested this several times: two phones, same search query, different results. I happen to fly a lot and spend more on airlines; and my prices come out over $200 higher than my friend's for the same international flights. Scammed me out of hundreds of dollars this way. Use Google flights through an anonymous browser window instead."
2019,4,Great overall experience. But I can't stand that it tracks when you're looking for a certain flight and then keeps raising the price. It's very unprofessional to present a certain price and then change it to a higher one when you click it. If that continues I will book my flights elsewhere
2023,1,"Fake prices, add taxes and $10 to every advertised price. Kayak advertises hotel rates at $58 but only for Agoda. Any other booking agent site add $40 so sorting from low to high does not work. When you click on it none of the rates are $58 it's 68 then add $10 for tax and hotel fees. What you usually get is a $78 hotel infested with bed bugs and claims of breakfast, a gym and pool when that is not the case. Agoda advertising rates on kayak are a joke good luck getting those."
2019,2,"The application has declined. The dates on the flight options show only 3 digits, not 4. So, November 21 shows as 11/2 not 11/22. You have to click on the option to know what date is indicated. Also, on the calendar, for various dates, such as +/- 3 days, the calendar shows brackets for only - 3 days. Finally, the application often fails to complete a search. It just ""times out."""
2021,3,"Well I did like Kayak, but now every time I open it, it doesn't show me the prices next to the travel deals, it just says ""Info"", and I have to click throughto the airline site just to see the price. I'm hoping that's some weird glitch. I'm not going to click on every option 3 times just to see what the price it...kind of defeats the purpose of your app. I will uninstall this app in a damn hurry if it keeps wasting my time like this!"
2019,4,We booked our trip to Paris using Kayak. This is a great app. It has trip notification you can track the price drop and rises. Their when to buy when it's the cheapest was an excellent tool. We booked three tickets for under $700 each (estimated.) I gave a 4 star because I haven't use their hotel and car rental tools. I'm sure it's great.
2020,2,"From a software Product Manager: This has been my go-to flight search app for many years. Now, the search results show the lowest price from 10+ junk 3rd party booking sites that are generally considered horrible and risky. So the prices shown in list mode are not useful: ""Wow the Lufthansa flight is only $650"" - open flight - ""oh, it's actually $1200 from the airline, $650 is ""BudgetAir"". If there was a way to show the price from the Airline only, this would be useful again. Back to Orbitz."
2023,1,"Went out of my way to actually give you a star. App been preforming really bad lately, slow and sluggish In the search bar it won't show you the country/airport you typed unless it's been searched before while the app was actually working, so basically you can't search new places or nothing if you cleared the app. Will change when fixed, but right now unusable Thanks"
2023,2,"This review is for using the trip planner in the app. It is a nice idea but hard work to use, certainly from my mobile. I kept ending up with multiple trips and had to edit everything from my PC. What would have taken 15 minutes on a spread sheet took over an hour on the app. Another problem was that individual events were in the wrong order. This particularly applied to hotel bookings that used the check-in / check-out times."
2023,1,"Great until last update, I was in one of my trips when I got a prompt to update the app. That trip no longer comes up or displays. On other android phones that I didn't update the app march 2024 trip is there, no issues"
2023,1,"I use other apps now. There's no way to reduce alerts to 1-2 a week. So, my inbox gets bombarded with a daily mail. The design was so much better a few years ago when it came to setting alerts. Now, I cannot even find a way to select the same airport to return to. I don't want to return to a different airport if my car is going to be parked at another!"
2023,4,The app is good for a person like me who wants to always travel but on a budget.. best way to find out the cheapest option on a particular time interval. The only drawback i felt was that there is no option for a train journey. Initially the navigation was hard but eventually when u get the hold of it things are understandable.
2023,1,This app is a classic example of BAIT AND SWITCH advertising. The price they bid is not the price you pay. And it's not just the baggage and other options you have during the booking process. There are many better options. Be careful of Kyak
2023,3,"This is a great app, but I can only give it three-stars due to its constant resetting of your baggage to zero for each and every search. These kinds of bait and switch tactics are the worst way to treat your customers. Just tell that Sales VP, no. Like everyone else, they should have to actually work for their keep."
2023,2,This app is intentionally displaying wrong informations and the search results are therefore useles for me: if i am asking for flights with one or no stop at all why is it showing me as top results flights with 2 or 3 stops even for short flights?
2023,5,"Great app to build trip itinerary so you know where to be when. The 'show driver' feature when traveling internationally is very handy. Also great to share trip with people so they can track you or know where to be of it is a group trip. Searching feature is also great, especially being able to limit by loyalty program or just look at cheapest, fastest, etc. Highly recommended!"
2023,2,"can't cancel my reservation, super painful UI. called the rental place and they have no idea, made my life worse not better"
2023,1,"I booked and paid a rental car 5 months in advance, just to arrive in a foreign country on the day of my booking and learn from Europcar that the booking wasn't valid. I had to make a new booking and pay again directly with Europcar so Kayak stole $1000 from me. I've been in contact with them for the past few weeks to get a refund but so far they've just tried to make excuses or shift blame to other parties. These people are scammers and no one should ever use their service!"
2023,3,The flex dates feature is one of the unique attributes kayak offers but the calendar grid selection is frustrating and unintuitive when modifying specific dates. Flight information also isn't always up to date and flights in a trip will appear without a price or the ability to click on them suddenly
2023,4,"Good basic information. It would be nice to know what upgrades are available ( extra leg room, etc.) And cost for each airline, especially for Economy section. Lufthansa posts some of that but prices are not always clear. ""BASIC"" , ""Multiple Fares "" labels are too vague."
2023,1,"Don't trust this booking engine, they advertise on their website scamers travel agencies. Yes, I confirm that I have a potential fraud case with a Gotogate travel agency, which I was directed to book flight tickets by kayak engine!"
2023,4,App itself is OK but you need to get rid of spam listings from people like 'TravelUp' who lie about the price to get you to click their link
2023,2,Terrible search. It keeps reseting my search criteria every time. I couldn't figure out how to use it or how to look for hotel and flight. Wasted half an hour battling with it and went back to using the Web version. Maybe it my brain that works in the wrong way.
2023,5,"Amazing customer service! I had an issue with the search engine. Decided to write them about it. And they answer pretty quick, and provided a new update to fix the issue. Now its even better. And more options with more than 330 days in advance for air travel. Other sites wont show a thing. It was my second favorite site. Now is my first."
2023,5,"Best way of finding suitable flights when on a flexible schedule! I've been using Kayak for years and there's really nothing better out there. There's so many options to fine-tune the search, not to mention the option to getting a matrix of 7 by 7 days to see which day has the fastest / cheapest / most suitable flights. Highly recommended!"
2023,5,"Always the cheapest flights. And the easiest to review. I recommend only booking flights direct with the airline. The third party providers are less able to help you if your flight gets cancelled, for example."
2023,1,Terrible experience - downloaded the app and I can see great deals but I can't access them. I click and end up with a blank page! This has been happening for weeks. Developers help
2023,5,"Amazing app for organizing multiple flights from different airlines, events, and stays all into one easily accessible place. Great if you're the type of person that's very detail oriented!"
2023,5,Used it all the time when I traveled alot when kayak first came out in early 2000s !!! It was perfect and top of the service industries agencies I can't believe they've slacked off in any way here in the 2023s I trust kayak now s I did way back then I've got 2 trips coming up to Palm Springs and another to S an Diego I will be using kayak both trips not the other services 😀 😄 😉 kayak has my heart for life
2023,5,Kayak is the most practical way of buying your airfare (to any place in the world) without any hassle and doubt.
2023,5,Kayak has been my go-to app for a handy comparison of flights and cars for a few years now. You can purchase right through the app. Fast accurate and easy to use.
2023,1,"Used to work, got to a point that it started searching forever without returning any results. I uninstalled, reinstall... nothingng. It's been a couple of months . I reinstalled it again today, and it's the same problem."
2023,5,I've been using Kayak for years. It's the best app! Love how easy it is to compare flights. Lots of great filters to get exactly the type of flight you want.
2023,5,Very handy Andy easy to use. I like that there is searchoption with luggage and flexibility dates as well as suggestions for the cheapest flight option.
2023,5,Great app for collecting all itinerary details together. One place to look when you forget where you are going or when you planned to be there!
2023,5,Easy navigation and great options.
2023,2,Two stars because not All websites or companies are trusted or professional. I asked kayak to provide me email to one of those company and never replied to me.
2023,5,It shows me options other sites don't and I have never had a problem.
2023,5,This application is the most efficient and cost-effective way to book flights and hotels.
2023,2,Quite annoying. Even when you filter for checked bags they give you a price but the actual price doesn't include checked bags. Totally not transparent.
2023,4,it's a nice app for people with low money and want to go on a trip but the app makes your choice disappear
2023,1,App is unusable. PLEASE FIX! I've used this app for many years but latest update hangs and crashes every time I try to open it. I have to use the web/desktop site now.
2023,5,"There's not a lot more you could want from a travel app. Searching for hotels and flights is easy, good filter settings to narrow down what your looking for, useful in the map view, heatmaps for attractions, shopping,night life etc. overlooked feature is the kayak trip manager, just as good if not better than some of the alternatives. You can even import accommodation, flights,buses, trains, galleries, even if booked through external providers, or obsucure tickets. I'm impressed, and it's free!"
2019,2,"Really liked the look of it-modern and great updates and love the email storage feature, but its hard to quickly distinguish what type of travel each line is. Would love to have clear icons specifying whether we have a flight, train, car or accommodation. for those long trips it would be handy to quickly view. until then I'll use the competition's."
2023,2,The same locations are available elsewhere significantly cheaper almost 100% of the time in my experience
2023,5,Kayak offers the best possible flight prices!
2019,3,"It's my favorite booking app; not perfect but usually fits good my needs. Unfortunately recently the filter for ""Direct"" flights got broken; it filters out everything even when one can see choices available without stopovers in the unfiltered view. It makes finding flights more painful and wastes time. Please fix it for getting an additional star."
2021,4,"Thanks for the great app! In the search results list I still see the price per person instead of the total price per group (according to the number of travellers entered), which is somewhat misleading. Could you please replace the amount shown with the total or just add below another line stating 'total' (as they do in Skyscanner)?"
2023,1,"I never wanted to install your app. PEROID. Now the app. Multiplied and I now have 5 icons. Will not allow it to uninstall, remove even from settings. Your whole app. Should be nucked form orbit! What a waste of time!"
2023,5,"a fast, easy. thorough review of most available flights...to anywhere. Used for years with good results."
2023,2,"you put in one class & every single time, it gives me economy. If I wanted to fly economy, I would have put that into my criteria."
2023,5,"Been using it for many years, has all the features needed to book for travel"
2023,5,Great tool when travelling and very accurate
2023,1,"The app is worthless in finding flights. It won't let me change airports and defaults to my ISPs web server's location. Lousy programming, for sure."
2023,5,This app is great at finding the best flights. it does the search for you.
2023,3,I don't use this app enough. I only have a phone and when I try to book multiple flights I find it difficult to get them in the proper order or I don't seem to get the best deals. Maybe it's just me and my lack of knowledge
2023,3,"well it is Really Good!!! but you guys need a Better Scam Filtering... also a way to Rate your own ""Partner"" booking sites"
2023,5,By far the best app to organize and track your trips.
2023,1,"Don't download this apps,, the price difference and double,, if someone doesn't know,, you will be good fish,, so try it with different app ,"
2023,2,"Worked well until the most recent update. Now the app crashes whenever I try to view an upcoming trip, which is why I use the app in the first place."
2023,1,"kindly ensure that when someone cancels, refund is done immediately"
2023,1,"Search feature doesn't work, never has, always returns an error. Won't waste your time with this app, try SkyScanner"
2023,1,"App doesn't work. After searching on a flight, shows no results and only a button saying search cheapest days."
2023,1,"Not sure how the business model changed, but this site is no longer what it used to be originally. I use it just to search now a days and purchase directly from the airlines."
2023,1,"I have updated the apps just now. However, when i try to find flights after the update, the apps keep unresponding. I'd try several times but still unresponding."
2023,5,"Nice interface, easy to use. I especially like the flexible days options."
2022,1,"Avoid. A single KAYAK design choice will be a deal breaker for most users. I've built my trip plan, landed overseas and started to add further events, until... ""This trip has reached the limit of events we can add to it; please create a new trip."" Ummm - no - please design an app that makes its constraints clear from the outset (this one is ridiculous). I recommend other users look at competing apps/software."
2023,5,"Such an easy platform to use, search and find the best ticket, stay and transport, for whatever your travel priorities may be!"
2018,3,"1) I Have set my CURRENCY to my Country, BUT, Strangely but true, each time I try to view a hotel to find out its prices, it automatically came back as ""£"" currency, so it's a shame cuz the pricing comparison is quite good actually. FIX that, meanwhile I will return to my usual App to check on prices & to book. 2) There aren't enough DESCRIPTIONS listed in each hotel I'm viewing, so i can't really figure out details i needed for each hotel I view/open."
2018,5,"Best app I've ever downloaded!! The 'Trips' feature is absolutely incredible, it lays out your whole trip with every single piece of information you could possibly need by retrieving the information from your confirmation emails - even if they weren't booked through Kayak! Can't express how much I love this app, has massively exceeded expectations!!"
2023,1,6 dollars a day for rental and then you check price $30 a day false advertisement should be a criminal offense 👎
2019,1,"The cheapest flights were offered by Crystal Travel, however, it is impossible to book any of these flights. After submitting payment details booking is declined due ""dynamic changes with availability of flights"". However, if you do another search, the same flight and price is returned by the Kayak app. This makes the app effectively useless as a search tool. (I wonder how legal this business model actually is??)"
2023,5,Excellent application to xompare the flights and travel!
2021,1,"Have been a user for many years and preffered this to other sites such as trippit. However Since one of the new updates, I have not been able to log into my account. I have tried resetting my password numerous times and it says that it will send me an email but I never seem to be getting it. I have tried doing it on the app and on the website but same issue. I have tried contacting them but again no response. I really do not want to loose my previous records."
2019,1,"Terrible experience. This new version had offers from many new sites. Every single one of them had an initial low price but after filling out all the required info, a popup announced that the price was no longer valid and of course after redoing it, the price had gone up well over $100. After 5 attempts, I gave up on this app."
2019,3,"Good idea but this app (or the website) just does not remember what filters you have applied. I try to input dates and it just doesn't show me flights for those dates (example: imputed dates in August, flights shown for May). Love the feature to see flights to anywhere with the map, just wish the filters actually worked"
2019,3,"App works well. But I catch flights in various parts of the world I rarely visit. It would be nice if Kayak provided some overview on airlines before we buy tickets. Their customer service, punctuality, cancelations, etc. I know what airlines to avoid in the US but not which ones to avoid in Asia for example. I would pay more for a ticket if I knew that it was less likely that I was going to wait an extra 12 hours due to a flight delay or cancelation"
2023,4,"The best available travel app. But it does have room to improve i.e. - the filters regarding number of checked luggage don't always work as intended, and therefore almost all results have to be manually checked. On car hire, different providers are listed of you change the country setting on the app e.g. you set the country as UK , and search for car hire in US, you will get less results than you get on the same so but with country set to US. Overall the best travel app I've come across."
2022,1,"Not a fan. Booked a room in Kansas, checked in for less than an hour. Nothing was as stated. No breakfast, no fitness area, front desk grumbled after every question, as if I expected amenities from this location as if they were listed as highlights - THEY WERE. Told front desk I wanted a refund, haven't gotten one over a week later. Can't really approach Kayak about it, so they might want to fix that HUGE ISSUE."
2023,5,great site is easy to use ... great prices
2021,1,"Expedia is playing games on kayak. Expedia will list low price, when you click the link then they will raise 2x+ the price. Expedia some others ruining it. By publishing low rates and bump by charging 3x more. That's just ridiculous why kayak team looking into it. Expedia will ruin kayak for sure. Kayak must act on to fix this issue. Otherwise users will stop trusting this app. I sent you guys screenshot on the email in this app. Go ahead and check it out Sent info to kayak didn't do anything."
2022,1,"Price Forecast sometimes is not shown, below price forecast sometimes there's a button that shows you the cheapest dates to fly to that destination but sometimes it doesn't show the button either, I have the latest app and have tried it on different phones so this is very frustrating. going back to Skyscanner"
2018,4,I love this app to keep all my trips together. Am using it for years. Only issue is delayed flights. Example: my wife is flying ET504 from DUB-LAX now. Flight got delayed 8.5 hours due to technical issues. Kayak did not recognize that and tells me the flight is on time. I live in San Diego and have to collect her in LAX. If I trusted Kayak for flight info I would have been waiting 8.5 hours in LAX. Instead I use flightradar24 for flight tracking. This has happened many times over the last 6 years that I am using kayak. Do not trust kayak for flight tracking.
2019,5,i dont use the kayak app for bookings but i do use it for my travel itinerary and i love it so much. it automatically syncs up with my gmail and puts all of my trip info into one concise easy to read platform. i travel a lot and use it all the time to keep track of my flights. it even lets me know down ti the second how long my layovers are or when flights are boarding. i dont know where id br without this app!
2023,1,"Maybe if I managed to use it my rating would be different. But app s unusable to me, it's crashing constantly."
2023,4,great app to compare travel and then book it with full integration with all your devices.
